In this post I'll try to summarize what I have learned about Software 
Defined Networking over past few months. This should serve as a guide to 
uninitiated as it is from the perspective of someone new to it. 

The excellent introductory video by Scott Shenkar will give you a perpective on 
SDN from one of those who coined this term in the first place.

While Prof Shenkar in the video is talking about what SDN can be in future,
because this video dates back to the formative years of SDN. At one level, 
or rather one manifestation of SDN is just automating tasks of managing a 
network and making managing large networks easy. To accomplish this seemingly
trivial goal, open protocols to talk to routers and switches have been developed
which hardware vendors are encouraged to support. This is against the proprietary
softwares and protocols used by most vendors, making centralized network management 
an uphill task. But as it turns out this is just one view of SDN. The [Open Networking
Foundation](https://www.opennetworking.org/) maintains the standards for these open
protocols. To get a good summary and a tutorial do checkout the folloing video:

Besides talking about the Open SDN, the video also talks about two other views of SDN, 
one is the API based SDN, where every network component provides rich API based access 
to its functionalities, and the other is overlay based SDN. The latter is more interesting
especially in the context massive data center networks. Lets talk a bit more about the latter.

Now overlay based SDN is where companies like [VMWare](http://www.vmware.com/solutions/software-defined-datacenter/in-depth.html) and [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net/) are 
providing solutions to mostly data center owners. Overlay network is just a virtual network
on top a physical network. This overlay can in turn be used to make more versatile and 
easy to manage networks that make it easier to apply flexible traffic engineering and QoS
requirements. For a more detailed discussion on overlay networks and viability of overlays 
in data center network virtualization, have a look at [this](http://www.nuagenetworks.net/blog/network-virtualization-overlay-and-underlay-design/) blog post by Nuage Networks.

And finally, I would introduce one *disruptive* networking technology reccently presented by 
Facebook at the @scale conference. The product is called Open/R, which ostensibly stands for 
Open Routing. It is a modular and distributed routing platform built from scratch to enable
quick deployment of networking applications on a large network. According to Facebook, having
a commitee based open networking protocol development sytem, slows down quick development and 
hence it chose its own path by not following the open standards and in turn did not need to
support a lot of legacy features. For a more detailed discussion on Open/R. you can check out
this [link](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1142111519143652/introducing-open-r-a-new-modular-routing-platform/).

###Conclusion
The summary of all this is just that the meaning of SDN is still evolving. It means different
things for different people. And the current manifestation of SDN is definitely not the
panacea of all that was needed to fix modern day networks. This is just the beginnning.
