In this post I'll try to summarize what I have learned about Software 
Defined Networking over past few months. This should serve as a guide to 
uninitiated as it is from the perspective of someone new to it. 

The excellent introductory video by Scott Shenkar will give you a perpective on 
SDN from one of those who coined this term in the first place.
